# How to Use

The plugin is easy to use and can be configured in just 1 minute!

1. Make sure you are OP or have the `headblocks.admin` permission.
2. Give yourself a HeadBlock using the command `/hb give`.
3. In Creative mode, sneak and right-click with the head in your hand at the desired location.
4. To remove a head, sneak and left-click on it.

!> Note: By default, any player can interact with heads. Negate the permission `headblocks.use` to prevent this.
