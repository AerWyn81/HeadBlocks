# How to use

The plugin is very easy to use, and you can configure it in 10 minutes!

1. First, make sure you are OP or have the `headblocks.admin` permission.
2. Give yourself a HeadBlocks with the command `/hb give`.
3. Now you just have to sneak and right-click with the head in hand at the target location you want.
4. If you need to destroy the head, simply sneak and left-click on the head to break it.
