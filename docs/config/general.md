# Configuration

When HeadBlocks is loaded, you will find the following files inside the **HeadBlocks** folder:

* [config.yml](config/config.md)
* [messages/](config/translations.md)
* locations.yml
* headblocks.db

## [config.yml](config/config.md)

This file contains all the configuration options to customize the plugin to your needs.

## [Translations](config/translations.md)

This folder contains all plugin messages. You can modify these files to match your server's language and region.

## Other Files

The following are storage files used by the plugin. Do not modify them manually.

* **locations.yml** - Contains all head locations
* **headblocks.db** - SQLite database file that stores all player data
* **export-xxx.sql** - Generated by the `/hb export` command, contains database data for import into another database
* **server.identifier** - (**DO NOT DELETE**) Generated when using a remote database. This file is necessary for
  HeadBlocks to link server-specific heads to the matching entries in the database.

## Placeholders

HeadBlocks supports placeholders through [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).

  _raw boolean_)
- `%headblocks_order_previous%`: If order is specified, displays the previous named head found (_raw integer or "-" if
  not applicable_)
- `%headblocks_order_current%`: If order is specified, displays the current named head found (_raw integer or "-" if not
  applicable_)
- `%headblocks_order_next%`: If order is specified, displays the next named head to find (_raw integer or "-" if not
  applicable_)
- `%headblocks_leaderboard_position%`: Player's position in the leaderboard
- `%headblocks_leaderboard_<position>_<name|custom|value>%`: Used to build a leaderboard (custom => see config file)
