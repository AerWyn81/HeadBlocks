# Configuration

When HeadBlocks is loaded, you will find the following files inside the **HeadBlocks** folder:

* [config.yml](config/config.md)
* [hunts/](config/hunts.md)
* [messages/](config/translations.md)
* locations.yml
* headblocks.db

## [config.yml](config/config.md)

This file contains all the configuration options to customize the plugin to your needs. It also serves as the **default fallback** for per-hunt configuration — any setting not overridden in a hunt file inherits from `config.yml`.

## [hunts/](config/hunts.md)

This folder contains one YAML file per hunt. A `default.yml` is auto-generated on first start from your existing `config.yml`. See [Hunt files](config/hunts.md) for details.

## [Translations](config/translations.md)

This folder contains all plugin messages. You can modify these files to match your server's language and region.

## Other Files

The following are storage files used by the plugin. Do not modify them manually.

* **locations.yml** - Contains all head locations
* **headblocks.db** - SQLite database file that stores all player data
* **export-xxx.sql** - Generated by the `/hb export` command, contains database data for import into another database
* **server.identifier** - (**DO NOT DELETE**) Generated when using a remote database. This file is necessary for
  HeadBlocks to link server-specific heads to the matching entries in the database.

## Placeholders

HeadBlocks supports placeholders through [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).

### General Placeholders

- `%headblocks_current%`: Current number of heads found by the player (_raw integer_)
- `%headblocks_left%`: Number of heads remaining to be found (_raw integer_)
- `%headblocks_max%`: Total number of heads placed (_raw integer_)
- `%headblocks_hasHead_uuid%`: Whether the player has found the head with the specified UUID from `/hb info` command (
  _raw boolean_)
- `%headblocks_order_previous%`: If order is specified, displays the previous named head found (_raw integer or "-" if
  not applicable_)
- `%headblocks_order_current%`: If order is specified, displays the current named head found (_raw integer or "-" if not
  applicable_)
- `%headblocks_order_next%`: If order is specified, displays the next named head to find (_raw integer or "-" if not
  applicable_)
- `%headblocks_leaderboard_position%`: Player's position in the leaderboard
- `%headblocks_leaderboard_<position>_<name|custom|value>%`: Used to build a leaderboard (custom => see config file)

!> In multi-hunt mode (2+ hunts), `%headblocks_current%` and `%headblocks_left%` will return a message asking to use per-hunt placeholders instead.

### Per-Hunt Placeholders

These placeholders work with any hunt by replacing `<huntId>` with the hunt's ID (e.g., `christmas`, `default`).

- `%headblocks_hunt_<huntId>_found%`: Number of heads found by the player in this hunt
- `%headblocks_hunt_<huntId>_total%`: Total number of heads in this hunt
- `%headblocks_hunt_<huntId>_left%`: Number of heads remaining in this hunt
- `%headblocks_hunt_<huntId>_progress%`: Progress bar for this hunt
- `%headblocks_hunt_<huntId>_name%`: Display name of the hunt
- `%headblocks_hunt_<huntId>_state%`: Localized state of the hunt (Active, Inactive, Archived)
